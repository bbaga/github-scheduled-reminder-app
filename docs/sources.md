# Sources

## What are sources?
With the source configurations we can tell the application what we would like to see in the reports, how it should pull the information and how to filter the results.

For example, by default, draft PRs will be filtered out as work in progress is rarely interesting, or in shared repositories, we might be interested in PRs where a team member is asked to do the review.

> âš  Once a source is configured, all other default sources will be disabled!

## Examples

```yaml
enabled: true
notifications:
  - name: something
    schedule: "0 0 12 * * ?"
    type: slack/channel
    timezone: "My/TimeZone"
    config:
      channel: "some-slack-channel"
      sources:
        - type: repository-issues
        - type: repository-prs
          filters:
            - type: draft-filter
              include-drafts: true
        - type: search-prs-by-reviewers
          users:
            - foo
            - bar
        - type: search-issues
          query: "label:\"help wanted\""
```

```yaml
