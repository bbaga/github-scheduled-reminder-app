# Sources

## What are sources?
With the source configurations we can tell the application what we would like to see in the reports, how it should pull the information and how to filter the results.

For example, by default, draft PRs will be filtered out as work in progress is rarely interesting, or in shared repositories, we might be interested in PRs where a team member is asked to do the review.

> âš  Once a source is configured, all other default sources will be disabled!

## Examples

```yaml
enabled: true
notifications:
  - name: something
    type: slack/scheduled/channel
    config:
      schedule: "0 0 12 * * ?"
      timezone: "My/TimeZone"
      channel: "some-slack-channel"
      sources:
        - type: repository-issues
          filters:
            - type: label-filter
              exclude-labels:
                - acknowledged
                - pinned
                - wontfix
              expiry-days: 90
        - type: repository-prs
          filters:

## Repository Issues

          exclude-labels:
            - acknowledged
          expiry-days: 90
```

## Repository PRs

  sources:
    - type: repository-prs
      filters:
        - type: draft-filter
          include-drafts: false
          expiry-days: 90
```

## Search PRs by reviewers

```yaml
config:
  sources:
    - type: search-prs-by-reviewers
      users:
        - user-a
        - user-b
      teams:
        - my-org/my-team
```

## Search issues with a custom query

    - type: search-issues
       query: "label:\"help wanted\""
