# Documentation

The objective of this tool is to offer functionality comparable to [GitHub's team reminders](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/managing-scheduled-reminders-for-your-team) feature, which is not yet available for GitHub Enterprise users. Although there are several similar solutions available on the GitHub marketplace, this application is designed to be self-hosted. Additionally, it is compatible with both GitHub Cloud and Enterprise versions.
